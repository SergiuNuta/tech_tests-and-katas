* Any comments on the code as is?

- Unclear variable names
- Functions aren't pure
- Difficult to read
- Functions have more than one responsibility

* How would you test it?

- Get the code compiling
- Install Jest for testing
- Write test cases

* Could you use aspects of functional programming to improve the code?

- Make the functions pure
- Use higher-order functions such as filter, reduce and map
